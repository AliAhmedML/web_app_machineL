# Multiple Disease Prediction System

This is a web application that uses machine learning models to predict three different diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.
The application allows users to input relevant medical parameters and generates predictions based on the trained models.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

# Models
The application uses pre-trained machine learning models to make predictions. The models are stored as pickle files and loaded during runtime. The following models are included:

 - Diabetes Prediction Model
 - Heart Disease Prediction Model
 - Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model
